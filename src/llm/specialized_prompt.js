CCI -100 to 0: Moderate bearish cycle (sustained downtrend)
CCI < -100: Extreme bearish cycle (oversold, mean reversion risk)
CCI oscillating around 0: Choppy/ranging market (low signal quality)
CCI breakout above/below ±100: Strong trend reversal signal

CYCLICAL NATURE: CCI is mean-reverting by design
Extreme readings often precede reversals
Use CCI divergences same as RSI

Fisher < -0.5: Bearish reversal signal (price likely to turn down)
Fisher < -1.0: Strong bearish reversal
Fisher between -0.5 and 0.5: Neutral (no reversal signal)
Fisher crosses zero: Potential trend change (weak signal alone)
Fisher divergence: If price makes extreme but Fisher doesn't = strong signal

TIMING: Fisher is a LEADING indicator (turns before price)
Best used in mean reversion or chop regimes
Can be early/wrong in strong trends

ADX 15-25: Weak to moderate trend (mixed signals)
ADX < 15: Choppy/ranging (trend absent, mean reversion bias)
ADX rising: Trend strengthening (momentum accelerating)
ADX falling: Trend weakening (consolidation coming)

+DI > -DI: Uptrend dominant (favor long bias)

ATR is VOLATILITY measure, not direction
High ATR: Large price swings (use wider stops, lower leverage)
Low ATR: Small price swings (use tight stops, can scale up)
ATR expanding: Volatility increasing (breakout risk)
ATR contracting: Volatility decreasing (consolidation)
ATR near 52-week high: Market very active (momentum strong)
ATR near 52-week low: Market quiet (range-bound)

USE: To scale position size and gates, NOT for direction
Pair with directional indicators (RSI, MACD, CCI)

Imbalance 0.0-0.5: Balanced (near 50/50 buy/sell volume)
Imbalance 0.5-0.6: Slight bullish bias (weak buy pressure)
Imbalance 0.6-0.75: Strong bullish bias (sustained buying)
Imbalance > 0.75: Extreme bullish (all-in buyers, exhaustion risk)
Imbalance 0.4-0.5: Slight bearish bias (weak sell pressure)
Imbalance 0.25-0.4: Strong bearish bias (sustained selling)
Imbalance < 0.25: Extreme bearish (all-in sellers, reversal likely)

INTERPRETATION:
Near 0.5 = noise, low signal quality
Extreme (>0.75 or <0.25) = potential reversal (mean reversion setup)
Sustained 0.6-0.75 or 0.25-0.4 = trend confirmation

  KalshiPercent: {
    name: "Kalshi Market Probability",
    range: [0, 1],
    interpretation: `
Kalshi % is the CROWD's aggregate probability
Kalshi % > 0.65: Crowd strongly bullish (YES votes concentrated)
Kalshi % 0.55-0.65: Crowd moderately bullish
Kalshi % 0.45-0.55: Crowd indecisive (near 50/50)
Kalshi % 0.35-0.45: Crowd moderately bearish
Kalshi % < 0.35: Crowd strongly bearish (NO votes concentrated)

DIVERGENCE: If model says UP but Kalshi <45% = major conflict
If model says DOWN but Kalshi >55% = major conflict
These conflicts often signal reversal or model error

USE: Cross-check model predictions
High Kalshi alignment = high confidence trade
Low Kalshi alignment = hedge or reduce size

  CrowdFade: {

    interpretation: `
Crowd Fade = opposite of crowd bias
High Fade signal when Kalshi extreme but price stalled
Example: Kalshi 85% YES, but price near open → potential SHORT

THEORY: Crowds cluster at extremes, then markets reverse
Strongest in mean reversion regimes
Weakest in strong trending markets
Avoid in breakout volatility
